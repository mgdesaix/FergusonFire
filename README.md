# Ferguson Fire: Watching the fire spread

The Ferguson Fire began on Friday, July 13 at 9:36 PM along the South Fork Merced River.  It quickly spread and cut-off access to highway 140.  I was living in Mariposa at the time and working along the Merced River, setting up MAPS banding stations for Institute for Bird Populations.  The fire prevented me from accessing my work sites so I made this Shiny app that details the daily fire spread based on data from the Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination ([GeoMAC](https://www.geomac.gov/)):
