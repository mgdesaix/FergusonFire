# FergusonFire

The Ferguson Fire began on Friday, July 13 at 9:36 PM along the South Fork Merced River.  It quickly spread and cut-off access to highway 140.  I was living in Mariposa at the time and working along the Merced River, setting up MAPS banding stations for Institute for Bird Populations.  The fire prevented me from accessing my work sites so I made this Shiny app:
